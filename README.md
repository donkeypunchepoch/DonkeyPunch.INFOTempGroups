# DonkeyPunch.INFOTempGroups
First release of Temp Groups

Initial Release

Description:

This Temp Group system allows for those with an EPOCH Group to easily team up with other players.
This does not effect EPOCH Groups, the temp group members cannot unlock each others BASES, LOCKBOXES nor VEHICLES.
Easy to use, if their are any recommendations to improve this script please let me know!

3. Add the contents of Description.ext to your mission file. Same applies here as in step 2

4. You can customize the HotKey in keyManagement.sqf. Just change the 210 to whatever key you want in line 21 'case 210:'
